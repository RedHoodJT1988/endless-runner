# Endless Runner - Goblin Run
This is a project of mine that I have been wanting to develop for a while now. I 
have been using TypeScript for a little over 6 months now and wanted to see if
what I have been learning with TypeScript could be used to develop games in a
similar fashion to using C# (for Unity) or C++ (Unreal Engine). 

I am pretty proud of the project and will be adding more levels and different
versions of the Goblin to correspond with the levels. This project was done
to help get **Web Monetization** going. I believe in letting my player base
play a game without the use of ads to generate an income. With *Web Monetization*
that can actually be a reality. No more will browser based games or games built
with HTML game engines need to have ads built in for a source of income. 

I plan on taking this to the next step by seeing just how well this platform
will work on say and Electron project. As of right now the game I am building 
run solely on the browser but will soon have a desktop version that runs using
Electron. Since Electron is built with the Chromium browser and everything that 
runs on a browser can theorectically run on Electron using the same technology
I feel that this should still be able to work. I am very excited to see how
this plays out.

# Feedback and Suggestions
Whether I win the Hackathon or not this game will still be playable and will
still be a project that I continue with. I am open to any and all suggestions 
to help improve the game. I am a single developer and not working with a team.
Updates might be slow because of that but please feel free to reach out to me 
if you find any bugs or think of ways to improve anything about the game in 
any way.
